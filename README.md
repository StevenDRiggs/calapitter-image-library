Calapitter Image Library (CIL) is a simple place for users to store all their favorite images from around the web.

Currently, only web-based images (images with a URL) are supported, but the ability to upload locally stored images will be added with a future update.

## Using CIL

To use CIL, follow these steps:

```
1. Sign up via the button.
2. Click the 'Add Image' button to add any of your favorite image URLs.
3. Enjoy

(May view all stored images from all users by toggling the checkbox.)
```
